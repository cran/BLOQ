Description: Provides methods for estimating the area under the concentration
    versus time curve (AUC) and its standard error in the presence of Below the
    Limit of Quantification (BLOQ) observations. Two approaches are implemented:
    direct estimation using censored maximum likelihood, and a two-step approach
    that first imputes BLOQ values using various methods and then computes the
    AUC using the imputed data. Technical details are described in Barnett et al.
    (2020), "Methods for Non-Compartmental Pharmacokinetic Analysis With
    Observations Below the Limit of Quantification," Statistics in
    Biopharmaceutical Research. <doi:10.1080/19466315.2019.1701546>.
